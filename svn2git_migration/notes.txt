*** steps used :

1. rsync -av svn.code.sf.net::p/drawtiming rsync_svn
 (includes also the website contents, which I split out and is not part of this repo)
2. tweak author map and rules
3. svn-all-fast-export --identity-map account-map --rules rules  --add-metadata rsync_svn/code
4. tags : tweaked rules and used mini script from jeffgeerling.com 
5. inspect newly created bare repos


*** note about drawtiming.sourceforge.net website contents
It was converted to a git repo and deleted since it contained only one commit.
However the contents used to be part of this repo, and may still be examined by checking out commit 52d2a8622835a145f73913bbe04e7f3bd21d2deb
