# here is a sample input file representing an optical channel turnup.

TUNED=0,
LOF=1,
ATC=IDLE,
READY_NE=0,
READY_FE=0,
PRBS=IDLE,
CERTIFIED=0,
STATE=OOS.

# TUNED is set after autotuning finishes
TUNED=1.

# LOF clear while TUNED triggers ATC start
LOF=0, TUNED => ATC=RUNNING.

# a period by itself indicates a time slice in which nothing changed.
.

# READY is set in the overhead when ATC finishes
ATC=IDLE => READY_NE=1.

# when READY is set at both ends, PRBS runs
READY_FE=1, READY_NE => PRBS=RUNNING => STATE=TEST..

# when PRBS finishes, the channel gets CERTIFIED and goes in-service
PRBS=IDLE => STATE=OOS.
PRBS => CERTIFIED=1 => STATE=IS.
