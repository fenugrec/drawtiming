INTRODUCTION

This project provides a command line tool for documenting hardware and
software designs through timing diagrams.  It includes a parser for
reading an intuitive ASCII signal description from an input file, and
uses the ImageMagick Magick++ API for rasterizing and outputting an
image of a timing diagram.  Notation typical of timing diagrams
found in the Electrical Engineering discipline, including the signal
state transitions with arrows indicating causal relationships between
signals is generated.  I am not aware of any noncommercial application
to perform a similiar function.  It is written in C++, and has been
tested on Linux, FreeBSD and Cygwin.  

I use this software to document the design of hardware and software
projects.  I find the resulting timing diagrams to be a good
complement to call plots for some software projects -- especially
those with complex relationships between various signals and state
variables.  Prior to writing this software, I created timing diagrams
using schematic CAD software, but making changes to the signal
behavior after the diagram was drawn was too much trouble.

INSTALL

This package requires the Magick++ API from ImageMagick.  See the
INSTALL file for generic instructions.  Step-by-step instructions can
be found on the project homepage.

USAGE

Please consult the man page after installing this package.  The man
page describes the command usage and input file syntax.  It also
includes an example.  The same information with more examples can also
be obtained from the project homepage.
